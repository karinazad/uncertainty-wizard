This library provides simple and transparent uncertainty and confidence quantification for 
fast-forward tensorflow.keras models.

Import `uncertainty_wizard as uwiz`, and you will be able to
* Calculate uncertainties based on MC-Dropout using the Sequential Keras API.
* Do the same on pre-trained models.
* Handle Deep Ensembles to get higher accuracy and better uncertainty scores.
* Multi-Process your Deep Ensembles on the GPU by switching just one integer.

Want to know how to do all that? Get started with the getting started guide (to be linked here soon).

#### Installation

It's as easy as `pip install uncertainty-wizard`

#### Requirements
- tensorflow >= 2.2.0
- python 3.6* / 3.7 / 3.8

Note that **tensorflow 2.4** has just been released. 
We will test and create compatibility with uncertainty wizard in the next couple of weeks.
Until then, please stick to tensorflow 2.3.x.

*python 3.6 requires to `pip install dataclasses`

#### Documentation
A link to our documentation and user guide will be added here soon.

#### Examples
Our docs contain a list of jupyter based examples, which you can run in colab right away.
You can find them here: (Link will be added soon)

#### Authors and Paper
Uncertainty Wizard was developed at the Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (USI) in Lugano
by Michael Weiss under the supervision of Prof. Paolo Tonella.
