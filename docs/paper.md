The first paper [(preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00902) provides 
an empricial study comparing the approaches implemented in uncertainty wizard,
and a list of lessons learned useful for reasearchers working with uncertainty wizard.
The second paper [(preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00982) is a technical tool paper,
 providing a more detailed discussion of uncertainty wizards api and implementation.

References to the original work introducing the techniques implemented 
in uncertainty wizard are provided in the papers listed above.
