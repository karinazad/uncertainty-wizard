All Uncertainty Wizard Methods
******************************

Uncertainty Wizard aims for (and has, as far as we know) a 100% DocString coverage on public classes and methods.
We recommend consulting the DocStrings in your IDE while using uncertainty wizard.
Alternatively, the API can also be explored here:

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`

Note that these indexes are auto-generated by Sphinx and are not always very nice to look at.
Apparently a standard in many python packages, some people seem to like them, though ;-)
